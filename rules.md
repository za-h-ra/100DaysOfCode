# Rules

## Main Commitment

I will code every day Monday through Saturday for the next 100 days for _at least_ **one** hour. I will **not** code on Sundays. I think taking breaks, spending time with friends and family and alone time is very important and essential for growth.

## Start Date

### Monday, September 26, 2022

## Additional Rules

1. I will tweet out the projects that I build with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and #100Devs.
2. I will push relevant code to GitHub every day so that anyone is able to access my progress.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide screenshots or links to what I'm working on.
