## Additional Rules

1. I will tweet out the projects that I build with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and #100Devs.
2. I will push relevant code to GitHub every day so that anyone is able to access my progress.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide screenshots or links to what I'm working on.
