# Rules

## Main Commitment

My main committment here is that I will be working through the following courses:

- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures by Colt Steele
- 50 Projects in 50 Days by Brad Traversy & Florin Pop
- HacktoberFest - contribute to 3 open source projects! (I have a week left to do this).

And this isn't code related but I will be opening up an Etsy shop to sell Digital Products. It's a career goal to make some passive income while I search for fulltime employment. So I'll be posting about how that's going as well.

This committment is my new fulltime job as of now. I will code every day Monday through Saturday for the next 100 days for _at least_ **two** hours. I will **not** code on Sundays unless I make enough time outside of my obligatory life things. I think taking breaks, spending time with friends and family, spending alone time, is very important and essential to deliver results and for growth.

## Start Date

### Tuesday, October 25, 2022

## Additional Rules

1. I will tweet out the projects that I build with the hashtag #100DaysOfCode and #100Devs.
2. I will push relevant code to GitHub every day so that anyone is able to access my progress.
3. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide screenshots or links to what I'm working on.
