# Rules

## Main Commitment

I will code every day Monday through Friday for the next 100 days for _at least_ **one** hour. I will **not** code on the weekends. I think taking breaks, spending time with friends and family, and alone time is very important and essential for growth.

## Start Date

### Tuesday, November 16, 2021 

## Additional Rules

1. I will tweet about my progress using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag.
2. I will comment on at least two peoples #100DaysOfCode progress.
3. I will join [CodeNewbies](https://twitter.com/CodeNewbies) Twitter Chat every week.
4. I will push relevant code to GitHub every day so that anyone is able to access my progress.
5. I will update the [Log](log.md) with the day's progress and provide screenshots or links to what I'm working on.
6. Time spent on work-related tasks will not count towards this challenge.
