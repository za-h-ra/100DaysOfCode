## Day 8: Wednesday, April 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Another slighly slower day. I need to create a routine but felt super tired today so I just went through the "Working with Colors" lecture. RGB is an interesting thing but I don't feel I have to memorize it because when using colors in engineering, you're given the hex-decimals, etc.

If I create my own CSS stuff, I just go with what works and google the hell out of RGB and RGBA. But that was a good refresher!

The project we've been working on now looks like:
