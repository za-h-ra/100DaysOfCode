**Today's Progress**:

Learned about the Anatomy of a Computer.

A computer system is made up of:

- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory
- Input and output device (I/O Devices)

The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is made up of the following:

- Control Unit
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Registers

Memory consists of two types of memory:

- Primary Memory which includes RAM (random access memory) and ROM (read-only memory).
- Secondary memory which includes storage devices such as hard disks and flash drives.

Secondary Memory is the slowest. Registers are the fastest.

Input and output devices would be recognized as the following:

Input Devices:

- A mouse
- Touchpad
- A keyboard

Output Devices:

- A printer
- A display screen

A touch screen would fall under both an input and output device.

And then I did a few lessons on freeCodeCamp building the role-playing game.
