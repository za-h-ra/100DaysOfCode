# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 8: December 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Today I watched two lectures:

- String and Template Literal
- Taking Decisions: if/else statement 

This was review into how strings should/could be written and if/else statements. And then I did a challenge. It was the same challenge as yesterday but I had to write a conditional statement. So this was my solution:

```
if (markBMI > johnBMI) {
  console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI})`)
} else {
  console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI})!`)
}
```
