**Today's Progress**:

Watched some long lectures today and did a CSS exercise, which I felt good about! Completed:

- CSS Theory #2: Inheritance and the Universal Selector
- Challenge #1
- CSS Theory #3: The CSS Box Model

Inheritance is pretty much properties inherited throughout the entire HTML document that have to do with text. For example, if I set

```
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

```

The entire file will have the `sans-serif` font. But if I did

```
body {
  border: 4px solid black;
}
```

the entire file wouldn't inherit the `border` property because it's not text related.

I have to watch another video on it to clarify inheritance fully. The the universal selector `*` wouldn't let the file inherit any property.

And then I did a small CSS exercise to match th styles from the video - and I did pretty well. I was able to identify all the properities that I thought were in the file to style it. Codepen link: https://codepen.io/zahrakhadijha/pen/rNpvZRM

Then reviewed the CSS Box Model which I'm familiar with.

So I want to write blog posts, these are the topics:

- Semantic HTML
- CSS Inheritance
- CSS Box Model

That's it for today!
