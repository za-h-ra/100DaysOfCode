## Day 6: Friday, September 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Consistency with this challenge is definitely difficult when you have a full time job and a day full of meetings. After work, especially on a Friday, I don't feel like doing ANYTHING.

But today I worked on constructing a blog post on how browsers render a webpage. I gathered all my notes and am in the process of putting them in once place.

But I'm a little anxious because I'm traveling this weekend for a month so I have this other stuff to do and feel scattered. This weekend and next week I'll be OOO so I won't really be coding, I don't think? Maybe. If I have an hour to spare, I probably will.

SO I will finish that blog post when I'm back online but I'm going to pack.
