## Day 6: November 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Oof! The holidays! Ok so I love the weekends I can spend without needing to look at a screen. And just be in the moment and spend time with people I love. And not worry about coding in the back of my head. This Thanksgiving break was one of those weekends. I coded on Friday and got LOTS done. And got back to it today :) So here's what I did:

I started up Jonas Schmedtmann's course again and reviewed lessons:

- Let, const, and var
- Basic Operators

`Let` and `const` are part of ES6 and are used currently and SUGGESTED to use now. `Var` is out of date and, although browsers still use it, it's best practice to avoid using it.

`Const` is used when you know the data won't change throughout the course. It's also best practice to use `const` over `let` so that the code doesn't become buggy. 

`Let` is used when you want to be able to mutate the data later in the code or initialze a variable without a value. 

Basic operators make sense but when I was solving the lecture exercises, it got confusing because of the math. So definitely have to continue doing more exercises. 

**Thoughts**: 

Excited to get back to it. Doing math for exercises confuses me because I haven't really done it in actual code for work BUT I know it's good practice to do it. Obviously I know how to add and subtract. But when asked to do complicated math with code - I'm like uhhhhh. 

Should probably take a basic algebra class.
