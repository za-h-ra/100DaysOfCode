**Today's Progress**:

Started the CSS Fundamentals Section in Jonas' [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). He explains things SO well and I think this course is a great starter to his Advanced CSS course.

So we worked on the same project we've been working on but styled the content.

I learned that an `h1` can be smaller in font than other headings. That an `h1` exists the way it does for semantic purposes. I've always thought that an `h1` will always have to be bigger than the `h2`, `h3`, `h4,` `h5` and `h6`. So that was a good learn.

Also refreshed my knowledged on descendant selectors and combining selectors to avoid repeating CSS declarations. From the knowledge I have, I don't think selecting CSS elements like this

```
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
p,
li {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

is smart. If I want something to be a specific font, to select the root selector. BUT I'm sure I'll refresh my knowledge on that soon too!

Didn't code on the weekend and it's a good time away from doing studying so I come back more motivated and refreshed to learn.

Also, almost solved a regex problem at work so YAY.
