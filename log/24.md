## Day 24: January 4, 2021

<br>

**Today's Progress**: Happy New Year! Coming back to coding was a little difficult today because I was feeling a bit discouraged about my job search. I started the day off with conflicting emotions but I think they're valid for this process. However, I'm choosing to be more positive about the job hunt again.

Today —

1. I worked on my Tribute Page by writing up the markup for the landing page. I'm starting off with small pieces of a bigger project so I can grasp the material. No more skipping around. I want to master HTML/CSS — even though people say not to worry about it and to just learn Javascript, mastering CSS is so important. And I realized that I was taking shortcuts before so I decied to pay attention to each detail. So I created the markup for my Andy Warhol Tribute Page. Not all of it, only for the landing page. And then I added some basic CSS styling to set myself up. See links to the progress I made:

2. I caught up on Conquering Responsive Layouts by Kevin Powell by working through Day 5, 6 & 7. I think these lessons are some of the best I've seen on CSS and responsive layouts. Kevin Powell tackles the smallest details and I love that because I learn my digging into small details and figuring out how everything works. Day 5 of the lesson required you to take a spec and implement it so I had fun doing that. I watched the solution video on Day 7 of the lesson and I implemented the spec differently, but it wasn't completely off. I'm going to watch the solution video again because he explains ```width``` and ```max-width``` really well and also how each % of the width works within parent-child elements.

This was the spec: ![](https://i.imgur.com/jQXnnll.png)

And this was my implementation:

3. I also watched Kevin Powell's Youtube video on ```box-sizing: border-box``` to understand it better and why we use it. And then I read an article on CSS Tricks about best practices. I like these videos breaking smaller things down that we consistently use. I use ```border-box``` all the time but didn't quite understand why. Now I get it!
