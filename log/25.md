## Day 25: January 10, 2021

<br>

**Today's Progress**: I've been a little MIA the last few days. The last week was a hard week but also an interesting one. 

I started on day 25 on Friday but then my laptop broke so I had to get a new one. Then the rest of the weekend was installfest session!

However, I'm picking up from where I left off. I took a stab at Kevin Powell's flexbox challenge. I realized that focusing and trying to master one thing is so interesting. I know how to use flexbox generally, but never really dove deep into it. Or CSS in general and it takes up SO much time. But I'm enjoying it. So today I coded for quite some time:

1. Worked implemented the mockup from the Conquering Responsive Layouts course. I had to implement the following mockup:

And this was my result:

  Which I thought was fairly close to the original thing. I didn't know how to get the text to align in the way it's done in the mockup, but I'll think about it some more tomorrow.

  2. I worked on my Andy Warhol Tribute page once again. I want to be done with it but I really want to master small things in CSS and I keep changing my mind about the mockup I want to implement. BUT I finally found a [site](https://www.behance.net/gallery/100881991/Origin?tracking_source=search_projects_recommended) that I really liked that I'm going to try to build and use as my tribute page.

 I want to try to implement the text between two sections of a webpage. I think this style is so pretty and the ideas I have for the tribute page could look really look when I learn to implement this.

My first strugged with my project was to get the ```background-image``` in the ```hero``` container to be in a fixed position. I tried ```background-attachment: fixed;``` but it didn't work. The background image moves as I move my screen. So this is going to be my first challenge.

AND THEN my second challenge is going to be to try to overlay the text on top of two divs. Is that even the right phrasing for what I'm doing to do?

Here's what I've got so far:
