**Today's Progress**: I finished watching one of the React lessons from GA. I think I understand how ```props``` work but I have to use them in a bigger application. I've somewhat put a pause on the udemy courses but I'm going to attempt to get back to them next week.

I wanted to attempt the Facebook Status Widget again because I broke it last time. I feel like I'm learning some of the smallest things I didn't fully grasp during the bootcamp ‚Äî like how I can import the ```FontAwesome``` library in my ```index.html``` file instead of installing it in my ```package.json```. I mean I could do that too but it seemed so much simpler to just put the minified link to it in my ```index.html```. I was able to use the icons quickly. 

So I actually created the widget. It's not a functionining Facebook Widget YET and it's not styled but I want to follow along the tutorial just to understand how certain parts of React work. It's more of a refresher and it's interesting to see the framework for the second time because I'm noticing things I didn't notice a few months ago. 

Here's my progress so far:

Last time I couldn't figure out why my components weren't working or importing. I think I may have deleted a file by acccident that I thought was unneccesary. Idk ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but it works now! 

So I'm also thinking of re-creating my portfolio in React. But that's a next week Zahra problem.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling overwhelmed today. My head hurts and I'm feeling a bit of anxiety about all of this so I spent a few hours on this Facebook Widget app and I'm going to continue the rest of it tomorrow with more focus. I think it's a good idea to just step back for the rest of the evening.

**Link**: Here's the Github [link](https://github.com/zahrakhadijha/facebook-status-widget) to all the code I've ~~followed~~ along with so far.
