**Today's Progress**:

We're at DOM Manipulation and Event Fundamentals! It's crazy â€” I remember when I was first learning to code, DOM Manipulation scared me off and I didn't want to go back to it because I just didn't get it. But working in development and seeing code all the time, it starts to click.

So today the course introduced a project called "Guess My Number" and it's the application we'll be playing around with while learning about DOM concepts.

I just learned actually that the DOM isn't part of JavaScript. JS only interacts with it - WHICH I DID NOT KNOW. I thought it was JavaScript. looool. Now I get why React is popular, because it interacts with the DOM in a different way.

I learned about / refreshed my knowledge by reviewing `document.querySelector` and then selecting elements with class and ID's. I learned about `.textContent` and `.value` for `input` elements. 

But these weren't super challenging and I wish these lectures had assignments with them as well because they help me practice the code. 

**Thoughts**:

Feeling good and excited to learn more!
