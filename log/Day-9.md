**Today's Progress**:

Made lots of progress today! Reviewed lessons:

- Pseudo-classes
- Styling Hyperlinks
- Using Chrome DevTools
- CSS Theory #1: Conflicts Between Selectors

So it was interesting because I never knew that with the `a` tags, when you style a link, make the underline wavy?

`text-decoration: underline wavy red;`

I NEVER KNEW THIS WAS A THING. Learned something new. I also didn't quite understand what `a:active` was until today. That it's when you click on the link, it changes.

Then reviewd CSS Theory on conflicting selectors and I knew about the hierarchy of what selectors matter more and what styles will apply.

Maybe this is a topic to write a blog post on.

Next blog post ideas:

1. Why Semantic HTML is important
2. CSS Inheritance Explained?

Idk yet but def a topic to write about.

I'll be taking the next three days off because of vacation so I'll pick up these lectures on Monday.
