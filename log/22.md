## Day 22: December 29, 2020

<br>

**Today's Progress**: Not sure I'll get a lot of coding done today so I squeezed in an hour and a half to do the day 2 of Conquering Responsive Layouts.

1. Learned about ```em``` vs ```rem``` and how ```rem``` is just more consistent and will require you to use less media queries vs using ```px``` and ```em```'s. 

    I learned that ```rem``` is based on the root font-size in the ```html { }``` CSS element which is ALWAYS ```16px``` by default. However, in an earlier course, I learned that some people like to change the ```font-size``` to ```62.5%``` so that when you calculate ```rem```'s, ```1rem``` would be ```10px```. 

    To me this makes the most sense. I understand that you have to change the ```font-size``` everywhere by doing it this way since ```10px``` is too small but the conversion makes more sense. I'll just have to tinker and mess around with ```rems``` a lot for it to just feel natural and me to guess the sizing quicker.

    So lots and lots and lots of CSSing coming your way.
