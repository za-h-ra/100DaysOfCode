**Today's Progress**:

So I watched some more Flexbox tutorials but my mind wasn't fully focused so I'm going to need to rewatch them again.

I played around with CSS Suspender today and it's HARD. I think I learned more from this game than from tutorials. Such a great concept, and they don't give you the answers either, you have to figure it out.

I got to Level 9 and then had to close it out because I was late for dinner. But I'm going to try again tomorrow. I learned that you can select attributes and status of elements such as

```
button:enabled {

}

```

I didn't know that. I didn't know this was possible in CSS. I also don't quite get some of the child pseudo-selectors such as:

```
.foo:nth-child(4n+3) {

}

```

for some of the CSS it selected the elements I wanted but I don't quite know how the math works fully so I'll have to read up on documentation.
