# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 3: Sunday, September 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

I didn't code on Saturday. And I didn't do my #100DaysOfCode on Friday because I was doing stuff for work. But I learned some things today SO.

THINGS GOT FUN. So I watched a few videos on how the browser renders a website.

I watched this one: 
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IsQqJ7pwhw

And it's so interesting because I watched the first one and was like "huh?" I didn't get it. And then I wacthed the second one and his explanations were slightly more detailed. So I was like OH. OK. 

I learned that there are components that make up HOW a browser renders a webpage. 

`User Interface --> Browsing Engine --> Rendering Engine`

For a Front End Developer, the Rendering Engine was the one in focus. To learn how fast the browser renders an HTML document. 

And then I learned that there are layers to the Rendering Engine:

`Parsing --> Render Tree --> Layout --> Paint`

I learned about each layer with high-level explanations but then I got curious and found a video that explanations it in proper detail how the rendering path works. So I'm excited to watch that and dive deep into this topic.


**Thoughts**:

This is a challenging topic to learn but it's interesting to dive into something I don't have a lot of knowledge about. It's such a complex rabbit hole of information because when you learn about The Rendering Engine, you have to understand GPU and HTTP requests as well.

My goal by EOD is to write a blog post on this topic. Tomorrow - I'm going to watch the detailed video on how the DOM and CSSOM work to render a webpage.
