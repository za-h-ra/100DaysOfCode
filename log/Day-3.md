## Day 3: Wednesday, April 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Interestingly enough, I did learn something new about the HTML document structure. You really are always learning!

So today I completed:

- More Text Elements: Lists
- Images and Attributes
- Hyperlinks

Which in turn resulted in the images below:

I learned what `<html lang="en">` means which I never knew before. And it stands for specifying the language you are writing in. That's VERY cool.

But most of the stuff, I do already know so it's just review but I'm trying to approach it with a beginners mind, still, instead of getting bored and giving up.

I started to write the blog post as well and I'm thinking I release one every Friday. So spend an hour or so on Thursday writing a blog post of everything I learned M-T and then write it all out. That might be a good idea.

Feeling good that I'm at Day 3 and kept it up. Tomorrow I'll finish up the HTML Fundamentals section.
