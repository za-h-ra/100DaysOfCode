## Day 3: November 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
Reviewed Values & Variables in The Complete JavaScript course. I already know this but in summary, reviewed the following:

- Variables should be as descriptive as possible
- Should be written in camelCase
- If there's only one word in a variable, it should be lowercase. An uppercase first letter is reserved for object-oriented programming.

Values a piece of data that are stored in a computers memory.

```
let firstName = 'Zahra'
```

is a variable declaration.

And then I completed an exercise, link [here](https://github.com/zahrakhadijha/javascript-course-exercises/commit/2fdfcd9275f0728ca5a7e1aef92ef84ab57f5d6a).

Also published my article on hashnode. Thinking I'll publish an article every Friday?

**Thoughts:**

Feeling great! This was a subject I already know, so it's just review. But still useful to always have refreshers.
