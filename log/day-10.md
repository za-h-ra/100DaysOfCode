## Day 10: December 11, 2020

<br>

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a few things today!

1. Watched a quick video by Jonas Schmedtmann on **The Box Model** and I feel like
   his explanation cleared up some confusion that I had. I never fully understood why we use `box-sizing: border-box` and why we reset the `margin` and `padding`. Like I know it's to manipulat the UI/Design more but it made things clear. So it was super helpful to visualize it. I'm definitely a visual learner. ðŸ˜…

2. I've decided, since I've reviewed the fundamentals of Javascript and have some experience with vanilla Javascript, that I'd dive back into learning React. So I started [Andrei Neagoie's Complete React Developer in 2021](https://www.udemy.com/coursecomplete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/) course. To supplement this, I'm going to review the lessons and exercises from General Assembly and implement them differently this time with more time and focus.

    Andrei explained the React concepts really well. At General Assembly, we dove into React without getting the full picture of *just* Javascript but these lessons helped. I learned:

   **React Concepts**

   1. Don't touch the DOM. React will do it.
   2. Build Websites like lego blocks (with components).
   3. Unidirectional data flow
   4. UI, the rest is up to you

   I'm familiar with React but my memory could definitely use a refresher. I remember that I loved using it more than vanilla Javascript because working with the DOM is tricky. It's still good to learn so I want to master it but I think React makes building applications so much easier.

   
I didn't code much today because I wanted a refresher on the React concepts but tomorrow, I'll be reading up on [this](https://dev.to/aspittel/a-complete-beginners-guide-to-react-2cl6) post and practicing React again.
