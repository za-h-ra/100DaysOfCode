**Today's Progress**:

I completed two HTML challenges from the course today. I know I'm not challenging myself much right now. Simply reviewing material, which is awesome too because it provides me with structure to start my learning progress again.

So I added the "Related Posts" section on this HTML document:

and this is the HTML structure for it:

And then I did a codepen challenge to create a "component." I've never heard of the concept of components when learning HTML so that's going to be interesting. I've only learned about it in React.

But here's the codepen file for what I wrote:

I also wrote a blog post on the most commonly used HTML tags. It's to help with my writing, give me structure and to try to fully understand web development. As I was writing it, it helped to explain it because it helped me understand what these tags are.

[Here](https://hashnode.com/preview/624cc09924471c433062c743) is the draft. Will publish tomorrow!
