## Day 5: November 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Ok so the holiday's happened and I fell off. Took some much needed time to rest & recover. Today, I made some progress towards things I've been putting off for a long time. I've been wanting to clean up my technical portfolio so I 

- Cleaned up my Github by deleting stale repos
- Redesigned my banner for my hashnode blog so now I have actual cute aesthetically pleasing branding!
- Re-designed my twitter header
- Updated my LinkedIn header
- Archived my older portfolio and added a "in-progress" page for new portfolio site that I've been meaning to build. 

The designing itself takes a while. I meant to do some JavaScript lessons but figured this would be more productive. To just have a "clean slate."

What I DID learn was how to add social sharing tags in my code for my portfolio!

```
<meta property="og:title" content="Zahra Khan | Front End Engineer" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<meta property="og:image" content="https://i.imgur.com/xbm9ftC.png"/>
<meta property="og:url" content="https://zahrakhadijha.com/" />
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://i.imgur.com/xbm9ftC.png" />
```

At first, I added a link locally for the image and it didn't work but learned from the Twitter community that it has to be an absolute URL. So now it works!

**Thoughts**:

Feeling good! Here are some links to what I worked on:
