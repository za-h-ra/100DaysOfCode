**Today's Progress**:

Today, I spent some time watching videos on ["What is the Internet"](https://roadmap.sh/guides/what-is-internet) and I have gathered that the internet is a wire.

Well...it's more complex than that. It's funny because often I don't really think about the fact that someone invented it. But I learned that it was invented accidentally by Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf.

It started off as an experimental packet network and ended up working to send data in small chunks.

I knew that data traveled through the internet in Bits but it was interesting to watch videos on how to physically measure data transfer.

**Thoughts:**

Feeling good! It's a complex topic and I'd love to spend more time on it, watch more videos. But people are right. It's a RABBIT hole. I started this challenge off doing some basic TreeHouse stuff and ended up kind of focusing on the Internet/browser side of things. But it's important to understand the big picture.
