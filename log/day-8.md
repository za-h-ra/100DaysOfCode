# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 8: December 9, 2020

<br>

**Today's Progress**: I did a few things today. A lot were not code related, but more so job-search related.

1. I spent majority of my day fixing up and refining my resume and cover letter. I got feedback from my career coach at General Assembly and feedback from a girl I connected with on slack. I did NOT realized how many hours of work it takes to refine this but I'm determined to make sure I'm not half-assing **anything**.

2. At this point, my brain is a little mush from trying to make my cover letter perfect. But I made it a point to cut myself off and watch more of Jonas's course. These lessons were on how to tackle complex problems and breaking them down into sub problems, which I thought was super helpful because I've always been a little intimidating by those LeetCode and Hankerrank problems. He provided 4 Steps to Solve Any Problem.

* Make sure you 100% understand the problem. Ask the right questions to get a clearer picture of the problem.
* Divide and conquer: break a big problem into small sub problems.
* Don't be afraid to do as much research as you have to.
* For bigger problems, write psuedo-code before writing the actual code.


I've heard these rules SO many times but never quite knew what and how to implement them. Jonas walked-through a problem together, explaining and breaking down each step and it helped me understand how to efficiently break down problems. So to put into practice, I'm doing to attempt the coding challenge from the course AND try out Hackerrank problems. 

3. I wrote a [blog post](https://dev.to/zahrakhadijha/52-virtual-cups-of-coffee-a-developers-journey-for-navigating-uncertainties-2j01)! I've always wanted to get into blogging in some form. I want to be able to write a technical blog but I don't believe I have a stance on something code related yet because I'm so new at this. However, I'm going to write about something I enjoy â€” which is connecting with people and learning from them in my career journey. And eventually, once I know how to tackle problems better, I'll write about code and my process tackling problems and personal projects. 

So not much coding today but it was filled with a lot of progress and knowledge. Job searching is a full-time job on its own. Learning to code and practicing solving problems is also a big chunk of time. And getting mentorship is a lot too. But I'm excited for it all.
