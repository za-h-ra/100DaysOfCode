**Today's Progress**:

COMPLETED the CSS Fundamentals section! Watched lectures on mainly developer skills: how to google things when I'm unsure about CSS properties and how to debug the code when the CSS property seems off.

It's a skill I use daily anyway, to google things but it always helps to review again.

Ended the section with a challenge where I had to use `pseudo-elements` and `display: inline-block;` I definitely have to review CSS Boxes again but here is the codepen link: https://codepen.io/zahrakhadijha/pen/rNpvZRM

I'm proud of myself to be able to understand `absolute` and `relative` positioning and how to style it. Because I didn't get it before.
