**Today's Progress**:

I learned about semantic tags and semantic HTML that comes with HTML:5.

This course by Jonas Schmedtmann is really good - like there are tags and HTML structure that I didn't fully think about. I know how to write it but when I'm creating stuff on my own, it's easy to forget. I completed lessons:

- Structuring Our Page
- A Note on Semantic HTML
- Install Additional VS Code Extensions

I learned about how semantic HTML is used for accessibility and readability for people who reply on screen readability. I used to think it was just for SEO purposes just so the search engine could read the content on a page.

Reviewed the following Semantic Tags:

```
<nav></nav>
<header></header>
<article><article>
```

And then a new one I learned about is `<aside></aside>` which I found out is for secondary information that compliments the other information. I've never used it before so that's something new!
