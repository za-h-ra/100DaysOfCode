**Today's Progress**:
Finished the fractions unit and decided I'd start on the AP/College Computer Science course to learn simutaneously.

It's hard. lol. I'm already famililar with what bits and bytes are and how computers run on 0's and 1's. But when they quiz you - some of the stuff is confusing. I know 0 means OFF and 1 means ON in reference to electrical transistors.

I thought it was fascinating how colors and letters were represented by 0's and 1's as well.
