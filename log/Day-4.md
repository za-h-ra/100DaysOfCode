# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 4: November 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Didn't code over the weekend. I think I might keep it that way. But today I went over the Data Types section in the JavaScript Course.

I meant to do more but I decided to dig deeper into the difference between `null` and `undefined` and really learn about it. And then I wrote a blog post about it.

Tomorrow, I'll be going over the `let, const, and var` lesson. I was going to write a blog post about that too but there's SO much information out there already that I may just not. Only because I don't want to blog just to blog about things. I want to write about things I'm truly trying to understand.

`let`, `const`, and `var` are important and it's useful to keep in mind when to use what.

**Thoughts**:

Feeling good! Today was productive - I have a blog post for this Friday. And want to just write more about the topics I'm learning so that 1. I get better at writing and explaining the technical concepts 2. Understand the concepts more.
