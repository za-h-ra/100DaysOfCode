## Day 3: December 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

1. I believe I made good progress today. Continued coding! So I did [Jonas'](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) lessons on Objects. This is where things got somewhat difficult because the lessons involved using ternary operators and I always have to look them up! But it's okay, practice makes perfect and doing them more often makes you a better coder. So I got through:
* Introduction to Objects
* Dot vs. Bracket Notation
* Object Methods
* Coding Challenge #3

I have knowledge in Objects and I think it's fucking cool that you can access all sorts of data with them. As I was writing the code for them and learning about the method, it was a good refresher knowledge from bootcamp when I had to access data from API's. So it made more sense how to do certain things now that I'm going through this course.

2. I finished the Applied Visual Design section on freeCodeCamp. Not sure where I'm going with these tutorials but it was cool to learn about ```@keyframes``` and ```animations``` but it made me want to just create Pure CSS animations.

3. I contributed to a beginner-friendly open source project! I've contributed to open-source via Hacktoberfest but I want to get more comfortable using Git collaboratively. So I've followed [Syk Houdeib](https://twitter.com/Syknapse) on twitter for a few years now and was going through his Twitter and saw that he had an open-source project he created. I looked into it and wanted to contribute to it as well. It felt really rewarding afterwards.
