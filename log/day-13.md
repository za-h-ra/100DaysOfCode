## Day 13: December 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I decided to rewatch Andrei Neogie's React lessons on ```JSX```. Instead of building out the monsters rolodex app, I decided to go back to my General Assembly practice lessons and re-create some of the assignments. One of the assignment was to build a book app using ```props``` just to see how it works. The instructor gave us a mockup to clone in React but since I had already done it, I wanted to do it with more detail this time.

So I decided to use ```styled-components``` for the CSS and I think I'm going to use ```state``` to render the book items. OR I may practice ```props``` first to really understand how it works. I have an idea but when you get into more complicated applications, it's a little confusing for me and I have to see it consistently to get use to it.

I did run into a roadblock at first where my components weren't rendering. But I think something is wrong with my laptop or ```npm start``` makes my computer extremely slow so I had to exit out of it and then re-start my React application. Once I restarted it, it worked. But I got a weird error that said ```unbroken token: "!"``` I'll try to research it more next time but I googled it and didn't really find a solution for it. 

Here's what my file architecture for the app looks like:

I think one of the best things I've learned from my peers at GA is how to organize files. Occassionally I've been on Github looking through Open Source projects and the files are everywhere and for someone newish, that can be confusing.

The progress I madde in this is that I styled the Header/Navigation with styled-components. I had to read the styled-components [documentation](https://styled-components.com/) to refresh my knowledge on how to use it. I THINK to style the ```root``` of the HTML file, you have to tweak the ```App.css``` but I'm still learning how to use library properly.

It rendered properly on the page without giving me an error. I have to add more to it so that's going to be a tomorrow's task.
