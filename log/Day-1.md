**Today's Progress**:

For round one of #100DaysOfCode, I'd like to focus on Andrei Neagoie's [curriculum](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-for-free).

When learning, I think structure is important. I've always been someone who does well with a focused plan with an end goal and a habit that came out of it. As of late, I've been blindly following courses, which has caused me to be unproductive and all over the place. There's a wealth of knowledge out there and sometimes, I just need to be told what to choose. So this is what I'm sticking with. 

Today, I read the article on the [Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230). If you're someone who loves to learn and wants to remember what you've learnned, this efficient technique is for you. It's pretty much:

1. Identify the subject you want to study
2. Teach it to a child
3. Identify your knowledge gap &review the material again
4. Organize + simplify + tell a story.

How will I use this? In blog posts. Something I want to become consistent in is writing blog posts for what I'm learning.

Also watched [Andrei Neogoie's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2HX_yT71umBgUzdKDfbuXnysZWqiGX4L) on how the internet works, which also gave an Introduction to HTML and CSS.

Most would think it a waste of time, but sometimes I love learning things from the complete beginning. Even if you have knowledge in something, sometimes new knowledge pops up and you end up learning things you didn't know. So I don't think re-learning and re-watching lessons on HTML and CSS are a waste of time.

Maybe I'll create a cheatsheet but learned that some of the most common `HTML` tags are:

1. `<!DOCTYPE html>`
2. `h1` - `h6`
3. `<p></p>`
4. `<strong>`
5. `<em>`
6. `<ol>`
7. `<ul>`
8. `<li>`
9. `<img src>`
10. `<br>`
11. `<hr>`
12. `<a href>`

But let's not forget about semantic HTML. More on that later!
