**Today's Progress**:

Getting back into coding/studying is hard so the goal is to build a consistent learning habit. Watched 30 minutes of the CS50 lecture 0. What I learned is that there is a digit system called `unary` which allows humans to count single digits. And then there's `binary` which is what computers use. `0` or `1`. And the best way to represent `0` and `1` is by assuming `0` means a computer is `off` and `1` means a computer is `on`.

Having many `0`'s and `1`'s means that a computer requires more physical resources or transistors.

Binary is counted by `2` to the power. SO

```
000 = 0
001 = 1
010 = 2
011 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
110 = 6
111 = 7
```

If we wanted the bit to be bigger, we would add another 0 which would be in the 8th place. So from right to left, binary is counted from 1, 2, 4, 8, etc.
