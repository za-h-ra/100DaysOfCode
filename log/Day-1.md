**Today's Progress**:
I started The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023 by Colt Steele. I'm feeling like my JavaScript/React knowledge is kind of slipping and I just need something structured from scratch to keep it alive. At work, I am doing Elixir work, which is hard! So anyways, I did some refresher material. I completed the course orientation, which was just an explanation of what the course will be about. And then I did the Introduction to Web Development.

What I DID learn (because, even if you know something, there's always, always something new to learn) is that the Web is built on HTTP. I knew this, but I didn't KNOW this. It clicked.

So the next section will be HTML review. I'm down to go through the course thoroughly and build projects so I keep my knowledge fresh.
