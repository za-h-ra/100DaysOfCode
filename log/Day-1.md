**Today's Progress**:

Started studying again. I bought a course to guide me through the technical interview process but realized that I need to refresh my knowledge on JavaScript! So starting from square one, but have a little bit more structure nowadays.

The two things I'm going to be focusing on:

- Hack the Tech Interview course
- The Complete JavaScript course

I have to remind myself that it's about the journey of learning, not the end goal.

Today - I reviewed Data Types in JavaScript:

1. Boolean
2. Object
3. String
4. Undefined
5. Null
6. Symbol
7. Number

And reviewed Strings. People think strings aren't important or not that big of a deal, but obviously many interview questions are asked that involve strings!

I learned some methods, that I haven't used in a LONG time, or even touched in years.

- `charAt(0)`
- `length()`
- `concat()`
- `includes()`
- `indexOf()`
- `slice()`
- `split()`
- `toUpperCase()`
- `toLowerCase()`

And then I started the Complete JavaScript course but reviewed only a brief intro to what JavaScript is.

Some questions to answer:

1. What are data types in JavaScript?
   They are types of data that can manipulated and stored.

2. Name a few data types?

- Boolean
- String
- Undefined
- Null
  (named them aboved lol)

3. Is JavaScript a dynamic programming language?
   Yes.

4. Does JavaScript require me to declare a data type?
   No because it's a dynamic language. But Typescript will make you declare a data type!

5. Which data type is assigned to a numeric value?
   Number

6. Do Null and Undefined mean the same thing?
   No! I wrote a [blog post](https://blog.zahrakhadijha.com/the-difference-between-null-and-undefined-in-javascript) on this.
