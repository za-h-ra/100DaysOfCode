The most progress I had ever made was back in December where I was keeping a detailed log of what I was learning ([archived](https://github.com/zahrakhadijha/100DaysOfCode/tree/main/log/archived)) Keeping these detailed logs in Github vs. just briefly posting on Twitter of what I did helps me solidify what I'm learning. I've debated creating a seperate blog for my #100DaysOfCode, however, I feel less pressure to reflect and just write my informal thoughts here, whereas a blog seems more sophisticated. So here it goes -

I'm starting my learning journey/refreshing my knowledge with [TeamTreeHouse's](https://teamtreehouse.com/home) Front End Web Development Track. Yes, this course might be a bit beginner for me, some would say it's a waste of time but I don't think it is. I need that "start from scratch, review everything relevant to work" even if I know it. I've been scattered because without the proper knowledge of Javascript, I can't learn React and Typescript. And I'm definitely one of those people who wants to know how everything works. I'd also like to dive into CSS animations because I find them fun to create. I don't get to work with CSS at work much so I want to strengthen my skills with it.

At work, I'll be learning more advanced concepts. My mentorship also created a 3-month cirrculum that I'll be following so I'll post about those learnings as well!

**Today's Progress**:

I started TeamTreeHouse last week and am working through "Introduction to HTML and CSS." Today I finished **HTML: The Structural Foundations of Web Pages and Applications**. Even if you KNOW things, there's always something new to learn.

**Thoughts**:

People look over HTML but it's important to understand it for accessibility. Recently interviewed a mid-level engineer at work who didn't know what Semantic HTML was and why we use it. So I recently learned that Semantic HTML is used for accessibility, and that Europe is stricter with their accessibility laws than the US.

Doing this course, I also learned that to point a link to the top of the page, you write it `<a href=#top></a>`. It's small but I didn't know that you can do it that way.
