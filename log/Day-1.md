**Today's Progress**:
So I have begun to review math prerequisites. I know how important math is to work with software and to really learn Computer Science.

Completed Unit 2 of Arithmetics on Khan Academy. Spent 30 minutes on it. I was never great at math but self-teaching myself how to do mental math is kind of fun. Arithmetics is definitely a refresher - but it's interesting because I wasn't great at word problems. With a creative brain, it's easy to start imagining word problem scenarios to be many things. BUT I loved seeing patterns in the wording of it and I'm excited to actually teach myself math.

So I'm going to follow the [OSSU Math Pre-Requisites](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites) because I haven't studied math topics in like 10 years. ü§ù
