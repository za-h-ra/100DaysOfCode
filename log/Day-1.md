# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 1: Monday, June 30, 2025

**Today's Progress**:

Started **One Week Python** by Colt Steele. Learned that Python can be used for:

- Game Development (that it played a huge role in the development of Sims 4)
- Web Development
- Machine Learning - which it is **THE** language for Machine Learning. Tools like TensorFlow, Scikitlearn, OpenCV and NLTK require Python knowledge. I have no idea what these are yet but I guess I'll find out!
- Science - it's really useful in the science world. There are tools written in Python for biology, genetics, etc. I find RNA/DNA sequencing extremely interesting.

I learned about the History of Python. All of the versions. And then installation. I already had it installed on my computer but I find `ipython` in the terminal to be really cool so if you're looking to install it:

```python
python3 -m pip install ipython
```

It's pretty much an interactive shell. So that was really cool.
