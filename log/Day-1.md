# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 1: Friday, January 6, 2023

<hr>

**Today's Progress**:
So today, a few things happened and I got a few things done:

- I wrote a blog post providing a high-level overiew of web development: https://blog.zahrakhadijha.com/a-high-level-overview-of-web-development
- Joined Days of Code Challenge by Women Who Code - so this starts on Monday and I've commited 14 days (to start) because I don't want to overcommit myself and then not be able to do it.
- Actually will join their Frontend Friday's challenges - there's one they posted so I want to complete it this weekend.
- Filled out a form to be on a podcast through a friend on Twitter, which helped me refect on the things I'm excited about in programming.

I didn't do much of "actual" coding but my goal with this #100DaysOfCode is to get my career going and open up as many opportunities as possible.

I'm going to build some projects, I'm going to study Data Structures & Algorithms, dabble in the world of Etsy and overall be committed to this path because it's fun and I need $$$ and health insurance.
