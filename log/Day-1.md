**Today's Progress**:

For round one of #100DaysOfCode, I'd like to focus on Andrei Neagoie's [curriculum](https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-for-free).

When learning, I think structure is important. I've always been someone who does well with a focused plan with an end goal and a habit that came out of it. As of late, I've been blindly following courses, which has caused me to be unproductive and all over the place. There's a wealth of knowledge out there and sometimes, I just need to be told what to choose. So this is what I'm sticking with. 

Today, I read the article on the [Feynman Technique](https://medium.com/taking-note/learning-from-the-feynman-technique-5373014ad230). If you're someone who loves to learn and wants to remember what you've learnned, this efficient technique is for you. It's pretty much:

1. Identify the subject you want to study
2. Teach it to a child
3. Identify your knowledge gap &review the material again
4. Organize + simplify + tell a story.

How will I use this? In blog posts. Something I want to become consistent in is writing blog posts for what I'm learning.

Also watched [Andrei Neogoie's playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2HX_yT71umBgUzdKDfbuXnysZWqiGX4L) on how the internet works, which also gave an Introduction to HTML and CSS.

Most would think it a waste of time, but sometimes I love learning things from the complete beginning. Even if you have knowledge in something, sometimes, new knowledge pops up and you end up learning things you didn't think you knew. So I don't think re-learning and re-watching lessons on HTML and CSS.
