The most progress I had ever made was back in December 2020 where I was keeping a detailed log of what I was learning (made it to day 25! Wooo!) ([archived](https://github.com/zahrakhadijha/100DaysOfCode/tree/main/log/archived)) Keeping these detailed logs in Github vs. just briefly posting on Twitter of what I did helps me solidify what I'm learning. I've debated creating a seperate blog for my #100DaysOfCode, however, I feel less pressure to reflect and just write my informal thoughts here, whereas a blog seems more sophisticated. I'm going to commit to this round privately to build my own personal habit. So here it goes -

**Today's Progress**:

I started day 1 off with Jonas Schmedtmann's The Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. I've taken this course before but haven't completed it so I decided to start over, solidify my knowledge for real this time. I watched section 6-8 - one of the sections explaining what JavaScript is and decided I'd write a blog post based on that on Why JavaScript is a good first language to learn. This helps me understand what JavaScript really is as well and why it's used univerally. 

The goal this time is to stick to one course, take it slowly because this isn't a sprint, complete the challenges and then to write about them to lock in the learning. Is that too ambitious? We'll see. But I switched my hours at work from 9-6pm ET to 7am-4pm ET so I feel like it'll be easier to time-block for learning instead of feeling like I'm all over the place.

**Thoughts**:
Feeling good and nervous. Let's go!
