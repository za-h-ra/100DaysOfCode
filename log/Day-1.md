**Today's Progress**:

I've consistently felt lost in my coding journey, feeling like I don't know enough. So I'm starting from the very beginning. Even if I know it, there's always something new to learn.

I didn't code today. I spent the day planning, which I don't think I've properly done, like ever. There's a wealth of resources out there and super easy to get distracted and overwhelmed. So I spent today planning strictly what I'm going to focus on.

- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Frameworks
- UI Kits
- UI Design Principles
- JavaScript
- React/Redux
- Typescript
- A sprinkle of Data Structures & Algorithms

These are the building blocks of what I use at work, daily. But I don't consider myself to be a great programmer. And I do shitty in interviews. So it makes sense to start from scratch and practice, practice, practice!

Also building sites with HTML/CSS and getting really GOOD at that sounds like a lot of fun.

This was my progress today. I bought Jonas' Schmedtmann's Responsive Web Design course which teaches HTML and CSS so I'll be going through that.
