**Today's Progress**:

Here we go, again! This one will be brief because I didn't manage my time well and now it's LATE. But to get myself into the zone of coding, I created a little tiny project based on the `50 Projects in 50 Days` course. But added my own little twist to it.

[Clicky click for the Github Repo!](https://github.com/zahrakhadijha/expanding-cards)

And then I reviewed the Big O Notation section in the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course. Each time I review this topic, I understand it more and more.

I retook the quiz for the section too and got 100% correctly.

So tomorrow, I'll review the performance of Objects and Arrays and the Big O Notation of that!
