**Today's Progress**:

I'm working through Educative's Computer Science Bootcamp. I'm on the first module: **Computing Basics**.

###### NOTE: These are just my notes from the course I'm completing so I can remember what I'm learning.

What I've learned:

A **computer** is a machine that manipulates information to assist humans with different sorts of computations. Any computing system can be built with only four basic functionalities.

1. **Input**: A device that can capture the information from the real world such as a keyboard, a mouse, a microphone, etc.
2. **Storage**: A physical space that can store the information from the input device.
3. **Processor**: An electronic circuit that can process the information stored in storage.
4. **Output**: A device that displays the processed information such as a monitor, a printer, or a speaker. All the visual aspects of a computer that we can see.

Every computer/computing machine (phones, etc) are two main components - hardware and software.

### Hardware

It's a set of physical components that make up a computer system. These components usually include the central processing unit (CPU), motherboard, memory, storage devices, and input/output devices.

**CPU**: This is the computer's brain that performs all the processing tasks.

**Motherboard**: The main circuit borard, which connects all the components of a computer or digital device.

**Memory**: This is the temporary storage space that holds data and instructions while the computer runs.

**Storage devices**: Hard disk drives and solid-state drives that store data.

**Bus**: This connects the CPU to other components on the motherboard. The bus allows for the internal communication between the CPU and memory, cache, and other components.

**Input/output devices**: The mouse, monitors, keyboard, printers, and scanners that allow users to interact with the computer.

### Software

Software refers to the set of computer programs, data, and instructions that tell a computer what to do. It can be developed using different programming languages. Without software, a computer would be NOTHING more than a collection of hardware components without the ability to function. Each computer program is built to solve a certain problem, for example, a calculator is a fixed-purpose computing machine that does somethihng specific to solve a what it was created to do.

Our phones, however, are used for many different things. And this is possible because of the software that runs on top of the hardware.

So what's a **computer program**? It is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. It can be designed to perform many different tasks, from basic arithmetic calculations to complex data processing. Computer programs, especially now, are used in SO many different ways: word processing, data analysis, gaming, web browsing, etc.

**Data:** the input that the program takes in, which can include text, numbers, images, sound, etc.

**Processing:** involves the instructions that the program uses to transform the **input data into an output result**. This can include simple operations like arithmetic, or complex operations like sorting, searching, or analyzing large amounts of input data.

Computers are part of our everyday lives now. They are used for communcation, entertainment, education, business, healthcare, etc.

And then we learned about the **Binary System**:

### Binary System

A binary system is a system that uses only two symbols or states to represent information. These two symbols can be used for these purposes:

- Up/Down
- Black/White
- Red/Green
- Apple/Orange
- True/False
- Open/Close
- On/Off

How would a binary system work practically? Traffic signals are a good example because they use two states to convey to the driver about whether to proceed or not.

Red means stop. Green means Go.

- 0 = Off
- 1 = On

A binary system can represent any information, including numbers, text, images, videos.

Numbers can be represented in a binary system by breaking them down into binary digits.

Text can be represented by mapping each character to a unique binary code.

Images and videos can be represented by converting their pixel values into binary codes.

The image from the course I'm doing. It makes sense. It's crazy how just 1's and 0's have created a WORLD of possibilities.

In a computer system, binary digitals, or bits, are the fundamental units used to present and process data. Each bit can be in one of two states, typically represented as 0 or 1. By grouping multiple bits, we can represent more complex information.

Quiz recap:

A binary system is a number system that uses only two symbols or states.

A binary system is represented in digital circuits and electronic devices by the presence and absence of voltage. The absence of voltage is represented by 0. The presence is represented by 1.
