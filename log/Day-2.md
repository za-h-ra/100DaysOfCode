## Day 2: October 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I need to remember to log. Completed Unit 2: Intro to Divisions yesterday. lol so I obviously know how to do division. But the word problems are fun because as an adult - I can see why I was confused as a child. All of the random information and numbers they give you in a word problem to make you think the information is relavant is so funny to me.

For example - one of the word problems was:

```
The local grocery store opens at 9. It's parking lot has 6 rows. Each row can fit 7 cars. Each car has 4 wheels. How many cars can the parking lot fit?
```

As a child who just didn't get it (...was I dumb? It's so obvious) the problem is simply askng how many cars fit in the lot. So the time grocery store opens and the amount of wheels the car has is so irrelevant to the question.

The only relevant information we need to know is that the the parking lot has 7 rows and each row can fit 7 cars. So it's `6 x 7` which is `42`.

Another problem:

```
The new headquarters of Khan Academy is at 314 Math Avenue. It has 200 windows and has 7 stories. The parking lot can fit 90 cars. The building itself is 63 feet tall. How tall is each story?
```

The only information we need is that the building has `7 stories` and is `63 feet tall`. So that's `63/7` which is `9 feet`.

You get the gist. So that's what I did. Moving onto "Intro to Fractions" which I always hated/found confusing to work with but let's see how it goes!
