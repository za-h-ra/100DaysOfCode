## Day 2: Thursday, September 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Worked through 
1. Make it Beautiful with CSS ✅
2. Adding a new webpage ✅

In these lessons, it was review of CSS Basics and how to set up an HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE html>`. Even though this is very beginner friendly for me, there is SOME value in reading through the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics#anatomy_of_an_html_document) on what the HTML tags mean/do. 

**Thoughts**:

Feeling good but not challenged! This section is a bit too beginner for me. The next section/lesson is on HTML Basics and I might just skip that one. 

The lesson just asked to set up an HTML document and create a mock resume so this is the result of that:
