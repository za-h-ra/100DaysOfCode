## Day 2: June 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

For today, I reviewed:

- Values & Variables
- Data Types (again)
- Let, Const, Var

The interesting thing was that in Jonas' lessons, he went over the 7 Primative Data Types, and everything that's not a primative is an `Object`.

And then I did the lecture assignments for each lesson, which were very beginner but always good refreshers:

```javascript
// VALUES & VARIABLES

const country = "United States of America";
const continent = "North America";
let population = 329.5;

console.log(country, continent, population);

// DATA TYPES

const isIsland = false;
let language;
console.log(
  typeof isIsland,
  typeof language,
  typeof population,
  typeof country
);

// LET, CONST, VAR

language = "English";
```

First, I declared the variables and their values, using a `string` where neccessary and a `number`. Then I logged it to the console.

For the Data Types lesson, I set one of the variables to a `boolean` type since it was meant to be a `true` or `false`. And I initialized a variable but didn't give it a value, making it `undefined`.

I initialized that variable afterwards to the `string "English"`
