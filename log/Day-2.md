**Today's Progress**: 

Watched the [Computer Networking Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBpuvPW0aHa7mKdn_k9SPKO), but only up to lesson 10. This stuff is sometimes SO tedious for me because I'm like "when can I code?!" but realize that it's important to know on how things work behind the scenes and how they've come to be. I learned the following:

`LAN` — local area network, which means it's a computer network within the same building. It could be a high school, college, small business, or a house. You share a computer amongst each other to share datta.

`MAN` — metropolitan area network, which is a computer network that spans within a city.

`WAN` — wide area network, could also be known has "The Internet" which spans across the globe. 

I also just learned what a Protocol is, which is a form of communication. The way the video described it was in human communication examples. 

There are rules when you communicate, such as:

- Talking one at a point vs speaking over each other.
- Whenever one talks, a response is expected. Or else the communication doesn't work.
- If there's no response, there's no communication.
- A specific response is expected from the specific received messages. 

**Thoughts**:

I thought this was a bit interesting, especially learning about Protocols because it's a term I've heard thrown around. But never fully understood. I'll continue watching more of this playlist tomorrow. Or later? Idk.
