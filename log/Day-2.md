**Today's Progress**:

This wont be a long post because I worked on a technical take-home assessment/project. But the fun thing about it is that I started learning `three.js` which is a JavaScript library that allows you to create 3D worlds, HOW COOL IS THAT. I was using it with react, so in react its called `react-three/fiber` and I didn't get too far into it but I'm excited to continue learning about it and create a 3D interactive planet.

Coding is limitless and the ability to create is ENDLESS.
