**Today's Progress**:

So I'm back from my career break and I've decided I'm going to learn Python. There's so much talk of LLM's and Machine Learning, there's no better time to learn than now.

I showed up today and learned about the Python Data Types. Similar to the ones in JavaScript. Integers and Floats are interesting. I used the interactive Python shell in my terminal.

These are the calculations I messed around with.

For the `3 * * 2` I didn't realize that the space would cause an error. I thought it was going to calcuate an exponent like it normally does. I think the integer/floor division `//` is interesting. Maybe I'll write a post about it.

I'm doing micro-lessons currently so I can build a habit of showing up daily here.
