## Day 2: Tuesday, April 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**:

Not bad, not bad. Did section 2 of the Response Web Design with HTML and CSS course. I completed:

- Section Intro
- Introduction to HTML
- HTML Document Structure
- Text Elements

I know HTML so it was pretty easy. Just went over the HTML Document Structure and elements.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>HTML Fundamentals</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

And then was given exercises to create HTML tags and elements and create a simple webpage. So it was pretty much review.

So I'm thinking, just to reiterate my knowledge and feel like I'm adding to the community with the knowledge I already, write a simple blog post on commonly used HTML tags and their definition.

I mean, sometimes, I don't even remember by we use `<!DOCTYPE html>` so it could be useful, especially for beginners.
