# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 2: Wednesday, November 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

Today, I just focused on writing my blog post on why JavaScript is a good programming language to start your journey with. AND finished it! Here is the [draft](https://hashnode.com/preview/6194748893892e4586937454). 

I wanted to do one lesson on Values & Types but didn't have the time and I'm trying to remind myself that this isn't a sprint. And blog post writing is A LOT of work. It takes me HOURSSS to write something up and really put my thoughts into words. So I'm happy I got that done. I'll post it on Monday. I'm going to draft up another one once I go through some more lessons and just have a backlog of articles to post so I can be consistent with it.

Writing the blog post helped me solidify my knowledge on what JavaScript is. It's the blog post I wish I'd read when I first started programming so I decided to offer my perspective.

I also participated in the #CodeNewbie Wednesday twitter chat today and that was fun to talk with the community. I definitely want to make it a goal to participate and join those chats more.

**Thoughts**:

Feeling good. Hoping to really make outside of work studying a habit and stick with it!
