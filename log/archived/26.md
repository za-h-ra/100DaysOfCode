## Day 26: January 11, 2021

<br>

**Today's Progress**: I did a little bit of Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts today.

1. I watched the solution for the challenge I completed yesterday. My markup was only slightly different from his but looked good, so I felt good about that because it means I'm on the right track to writing ~ clean ~ code and also implementing the CSS responsiveness.

2. I watched one lesson on flexbox for Day 9 of the Conquering Responsive Layouts challenge â€” on adding a Hero image and decided to work on my own project and my own hero image. I decided not to implement the wireframe from yesterday, but instead try something different. I felt good because I figured out how to make my text overlap my image and it's with `position: relative;` and `position: absolute;` but I did discover that it messes up some of the styling from the `parent` element so it's going to be fun to play around with.

So tomorrow, I'll complete Day 9 & Day 10 of the conquering responsive layouts course and slowly work my way through as I apply the knowledge to my personal project.

This is my progress for today:

It makes me feel good because it gives me confidence knowing that I **am** able to implement wireframes on the frontend. I know I'm not the best at Javascript YET but I'll practice it once I master some CSS things. CSS is a lot of work but I love design so I'm not bothered by it.

Now...time to binge watch Bridgerton.
