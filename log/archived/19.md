## Day 19: December 22, 2020

<br>

**Today's Progress**: So today...I started the day off with a power outage, which happened last night and my internet and electricity didn't come back on until the afternoon. I was supposed to meet with my GA partner to build our project together but had to reschedule it to tomorrow! BUT we got it back and I went on to practice more of React. 

1. I worked through Andrei Neagoie's course but I definitely think I have to watch some lectures for a second and third time to understand the concepts and then put them into practice on my own. It feels more rewarding when I understand something on my own to build it instead of following along with a tutorial because then I understand how the code truly works. The lessons were an incredible breaking of using ```filter()``` and ```include()``` methods in a search bar. I've used a search bar in a previous project and felt like it was a MESS because I didn't truly understand how the code worked. But it's just fascinating to see it again and review lessons over and over again to understand it a bit better.


2. So I don't want to just follow along tutorials. I used one of the assignments from General Assembly and re-did it to practice how ```props``` are passed from one component to the other. And it felt rewarding to just tackle the code on my own and really *think* about it instead of watching a tutorial. So I'm going to do more of that.


For the rest of the evening, I'm going to re-watch the GA lecture on React State and then call it a night. ðŸ’¤
