**Today's Progress**: MORE REACT. So I went back to Andrei Neagoie's full React
course to review some concepts and I'm starting to understand certain things I
didn't understand before.

1. I reviewed what `promise()` is. I guess I didn't fully get it before because
   when you're in a bootcamp, you're kind of rushing to cram SO much in such a
   short amount of time. A `promise()` is asynchronous event handling. It's
   either a resolved, pending, or rejected state. So I understand why we use
   `fetch()` for returning a promise/making API calls. And then what `.then()`
   and `.catch()` are as well. I'll definitely have to review again and put it
   into use mulitple times to visually see how it works but I understand it more
   than I did before.

2. Reviewed what Life Cycle Methods are. I already knew what they were but I
   didn't know the lingo. I'm also a little more familiar with React Hooks than
   React Classes so I refreshed my memory on `componentDIdMount()`. It makes
   sense. The way the instructor explained it way that it 'mounts' (renders) the
   data in the UI. And how you never want to change `state` so we use `setState`
   to let React know that the state has changed and calls the `render()` method
   to learn what should be on the screen.

   This is the code that helped me understand it a bit better. I know I'm
   definitely a visual learner to writing the code and then seeing it in the
   `console` and the UI helps me understand how each part works.

   ```
   componentDidMount() {
   	fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
   		.then((response) => response.json())
   		.then((users) => this.setState({ monsters: users }))
   }

   ```

3. I truly believe best practice for writing code is architecting it in a way
   that is readable and understandable to someone who has no idea what the code
   does. Architecting an app is so so important and I think I understood this
   very early on because I like organization and how files just look with
   consistent naming conventions. But also, with React, I've learned that
   breaking code into small reuserable pieces makes it organized and easier to
   access, track bugs, and understand where all code is located so you can
   update what you're looking for in an efficient way. Breaking an application
   down is just more efficient.

   For the Monsters Rolodex application, I broke it down as such:

   ```
   |__ Components/
       |__CardList.jsx
       |__CardList.css
   |__ App.js
   |__ App.css
   |__ App.test.js
   |__ index.css
   |__ index.js
   |__ logo.svg
   |__ reportWebVitals.js
   |__ setupTests.js
   ```

   I've learned to use `styled-components` so usually, I would break the file
   down into components and use `styled-components` instead of using a `.css`
   file. I think Styled Components make it simpler and easier to use CSS and
   make the CSS specific to a certain component.

4. OK what I'm really excited about is understanding what `props.children` MEAN.
   The GA instructor explained this to us but I was like ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ðŸ‘€ ?????? WHAT
   ??????. The way the instructor explained it was importing the `CardList`
   component into `App.js` and then IN the `CardList` component, he did
   `console.log(props)` and populated the UI with `{props.children}` as well. In
   the `App.js` file, he used the `<CardList></CardList>` and added the
   following code:

   ```
   <CardList name='Zahra'>
   	    {this.state.monsters.map((monster) => (
   		    <h1 key={monster.id}> {monster.name} </h1>
   		))}
   	</CardList>
   ```

   Which helped me grasp the concept of `props.children` because I was able to
   see what the code was doing in the `console`. The damn importance of visually
   seeing how everything works is magical.

So tomorrow, I'm going to work on my own little project based on what I learned
today and then continue with the lessons to keep on working.
