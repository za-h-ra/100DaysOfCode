# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 20: December 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: OK I'm so excited! My GA coding partner (Nora) and I have
been talking about building a project together.

1. Last week, we discussed websites that we found aesthetically pleasing and
   also which we'd like to learn to build on our own. We took features from a
   few websites and talked about it with eachother, which resulted in coming up
   with a really exciting idea for a personal project.

   Both of us have a love for fashion, beauty, wellness so decided we'd create
   something for skincare that we found missing in our lives. At first, we're
   like _"should we create a pretend product?"_ but then it turned into
   something even bigger than that! So I'll be sharing more about it as we build
   it.

   The most interesting part about this was that we were talking about just
   building a front-end app but this is potentially going to be full stack.

- We discussed the features we're going to build.
- What features we liked on other sites
- How to incorporate certain aesthetics

2. I spent the rest of the evening doing some design research on re-doing my
   portfolio in React. I have loads to learn but the best way to learn is to
   build something. So I'm going to throw myself into it. I don't think my
   portfolio fully represents me so I want to build something that's an accurate
   representation of who I am.

3. I finally thought about a name I would call my freelance gig. So I started
   ideating on logo design, etc. And then slowly designing all of it in
   photoshop.

I have to learn to not feel bad when I don't get actual code done. Planning and
Research is also a huge part of development, especially if you're going to build
something from scratch. I'm going to figure out how to manage my time within the
next few days but I'm excited about what's to come. And also, to submit more job
applications üíÉüèΩ
