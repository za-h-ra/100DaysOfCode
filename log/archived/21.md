# #100DaysOfCode Log

## Day 21: December 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I took a few days off for the holidays to spend some quality time with my boyfriend. But I can say that it was MUCH needed for me to get back to coding. Sometimes you just approach things with a better mindset when you've stepped away and I'm all for taking breaks when needed to avoid burnout. I started this challenge to improve my coding skills, build projects and **land a job.** Thankfully, coding everyday is already a habit for me so I don't feel too bad when I take breaks. I worked on a few things today:

1. I did [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s Applied Accessibility lessons. I thought it made sense. Lot's of HTML refreshers but I also learned about things I didn't know much about â€” I usually forget to put ```alt``` attributes on my images so I'll start doing that. And then the lessons went into some uncommon HTML elements but I thought the ```audio``` element was cool so I want to do more research on it.

2. I also did freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Principles section. It was only 4 lessons but lots of knowledge in the 4 lessons! My portfolio site has had trouble with responsiveness and performance so it helped me understand how to fix it. I've kind of struggled with media queries as well but it seems like a lot. I understand them. I know how to write them. But I have to write them LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS to get better at writing them and understanding mobile first designs, etc. 

3. Ok so this one was exciting. I did day 1 of Kevin Powell's [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts). His lessons on responsive layouts are great. He provides small bits to practice each day and then gives you a challenge to complete. Day 1 took me like 20 minutes to do which was great to fit into my day. And I learned that the web is already responsive, we just fuck it up with our CSS ðŸ˜¬ so that was nice to know. But also helped me learn about some CSS practices that I should avoid â€” which I've definitely used in my portfolio and my projects. I'm excited to learn to write better CSS.

4. I started on my Tribute Page Project via freeCodeCamp. It's on Andy Warhol. I did some pinterest research and found a web design I really liked so I'm going to tweak it to make it my own.
