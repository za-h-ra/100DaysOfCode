## Day 23: December 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: The first thing I did today was the Conquering Responsive Layouts by Kevin Powell. I like his challenges because even though you're implementing small parts of CSS — it helps me learn more this way. I'm getting more familiar with my learining style this way. Implementing the responsive design in challenge #2 took me longer than I thought though but it also made me realize that I have much more to learn. 

In the lesson, he went over ```max-width``` and ```width: 100%``` and then implementing it by making sure each container aligned and was equally responsive.

And then I did a creative coding course on [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Creative-Coding-Animating-SVG-with-Simple-CSS-Code/1735436116/projects?via=onboarding) for animating SVG and I thought it was interesting. It wasn't part of the plan today but I felt like doing something a little fun. It was informative but I don't quite understand how to minify/compress an SVG file to animate it. I want to add an animation into my new portfolio site so I'm definitely going to look into that. 

I thing creative coding is so interesting so I enrolled in an edX course at NYU. It starts in Jan so I'm excited to fill my brain with some creativity as I job hunt!

**Also, if anyone is able to help me, how do you compress an SVG file so you can animate? I tried doing it via Adobe Illustrator but it just came out with all gibberish and numbers khfgjkdhfgkjdhgjd** I want to figure this out!

I moved on from that and ended up working through the freeCodeCamp CSS Flexbox — I know how to use flexbox but haven't read up on the Flexbox rules so it's just nice to get all that information in. Tomorrow I'll finish that and put it into practice with my Tribute page :)
