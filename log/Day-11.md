**Today's Progress**:

Margins and paddings were a big topic. I think even now, I sometimes have some difficulty understanding it but the more practice I get with CSS, the more I'll get it.

So today, I reviewed:

- Margins and paddings
- Dimensions (height and width)
- Centering the page

I understand now why people start styling their page with

```
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

```

It's like starting from a blank canvas and then figuring out where all the margins belong afterwards.

Did a codepen challenge again and styled the page as it was presented: https://codepen.io/zahrakhadijha/pen/rNpvZRM

Centered all the content with `margin: 0 auto`.

Tomorrow, I'll review:

- CSS Theory #4: Types of Boxes
- CSS Theory #5: Absolute Positioning
- Pseudo Elements

I need a day to sit down and think about what I've learned so I can write about it and reiterate it. So maybe on Friday I'll do that? Idk.

Excited to continue learning.
