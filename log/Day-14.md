**Today's Progress**:

I started section 4 of the course on Layouts, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

I DIDN'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT FLOATS. I still don't get them.

So I learned about why we do a global reset with

```
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

to our CSS stylesheets. It gives you more control over the layout.

CSS is a complex super magical power honestly. I learned about Floats. I don't think they're highly used but still good to know.

I'm excited for Flexbox because I haven't used it in a long time.

I didn't quite understand why my Codepen project wasn't laying out the way it should have. But I'm going to move on to CSS Flexbox and attempt to fully understand what's going on behind the scenes there. I'll probably come back and play around with floats at a later time.
