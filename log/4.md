## Day 4: December 4, 2020
<br>

**Today's Progress**:

Today was a little rough with my attenion span. I spent the first half of the day applying to jobs and the 2nd half slightly coding. I wasn't super motivated today but I showed up! I didn't get a lot done but small progress is still progress.

1. I did part of Jonas' for loop lessons and I did the assignments for each lecture to practice and memorize. I find that I learn better in small increments so I can reflect on what I did. So even though I didn't do a lot today, it was still a good refresher on how to write a  ```for loop``` and how to ```push``` elements to an array within a ```for loop```. I completed:
* Iteration: The for loop
* Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing

My goal is to get out of tutorial purgatory soon. I read [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/escape-tutorial-purgatory/?ref=jonas.io) article today and I thought it was relevant. So I want to build a google chome application. I think I'll finish up the Javascript Fundamentals pt. 2 section this weekend and throw myself into small projects whilst applying to jobs.
