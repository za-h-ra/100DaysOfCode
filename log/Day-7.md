**Today's Progress**:

Reviewed classes and ID's. I know that ID's are rarely used in the industry. Classes are preferred because you can style multiple HTML elements with classes. And it keeps your code DRY.

ID's are only meant to be used once.

Was only able to get 30 min of studying in today but it's still something.

Tomorrow, I'll be more productive with the other lessons!
