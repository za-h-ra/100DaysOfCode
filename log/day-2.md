## Day 2: December 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**:

1. I love Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course so much. His explanations help me understand JavaScript better. Today I worked through the **Arrays** section and did the exercises after each lesson. I was able to successfully work through the coding challenge as well and I think it's because I have familiarity with Arrays. BUT what I did learn was that you can add various elements to an Array.

For example, I didn't know that you can add entire functions in an array like so:

```
const percentages = [
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[0]),
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[1]),
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[populations.length - 1]),
	percentageOfWorld1(populations[2]),
]
``` 

So that was interesting to learn! I also didn't really understand how to put into use ```indexOf()``` and ```includes()``` but putting these into practice with Jonas' exercises helped me visualize all the algorithms I've done in the past and where these could've been used.

2. I did 9 lessons in the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) Applied Visual Design section. I think CSS properties are so cool in creating the design and UI of your webpage. I kind of understand what the psuedo-classes ```::before``` and ```::after``` do but I have to mess with it in action. Maybe create Pure CSS animations. Tomorrow I'll finish up the Applied Visual Design section to that I can move onto Applied Accessibility.

**Thoughts**: 

I'm feeling good! I was procrastinating yesterday so it took me a long time to finish my daily coding goals but today I got what I needed to get done. 

1. For Jonas' course, I thought the array assignments were very intellectually stimulating and I look forward to doing them after every lesson. And it feels good to try to figure it out. 

2. I love UI/UX so learning about Web Design is always fascinating to me. Especially when they involve interactivity and animation. :blush:
