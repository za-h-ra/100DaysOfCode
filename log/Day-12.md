**Today's Progress**:

Ooof! CSS is a powerful tool. So I learned about:

- Types of Boxes in CSS
- Absolute Positioning
- Pseudo Elements

I'm inspired to write a tutorial on Absolute Positioning and Pseduo Elements because I've used these properties before but never quite fully understood them until now.

But I'm also trying to soak in the information and LEARN before I dive into tutorials. I don't understand the types of boxes fully yet so I'll have to review the lecture again.

With Absolute Position, what I understand is that the element is thrown out of it's normal flow from the HTML. You can offset the element by using `position: absolute` and style it however you want on the page with the properties: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`. You do need to put the element in a parent element that has to be styled as `position: relative`.

So happy I finally understand. And then PSEUDO-ELEMENTS!

I didn't understand the `::before` and `::after` ones before but now I get it. And I'm also inspired to write up something seperately for this.
