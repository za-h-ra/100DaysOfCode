## Day 12: July 19, 2022

<hr>

**Today's Progress**: lol hi. I SHOULD be on like day 30 or something but lots going on. So here are the updates: I have a live-coding interview on Friday and I didn't do well in that. (Totally forgot to write a for loop properly too, what an idiotü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) and then realized later where I messed up. It was in a google doc - so as a visual person I couldn't see what I was doing with my code in the console and crumbled under pressure while the interviewers were watching me. But it's okay, I reflected on it and I've moved on.

I'm also soon to be funemployed. BlockFi is offering to buy everyone out of the company and I'm gonna take the offer. Full on focus on technical interviews and job hunting. I got this. It was a hard decision to make and it's scary not having something lined up right after a job - but I have more skills now than I did before, and each day that I study, I get better. So keeping my head up and in positive light. ‚ú®

SO now that we're done with the updates! Picked back up what I was working on from the JavaScript course. Reviewed:

- Iteration: The For Loop (lol after that interview, I needed to review this haha)
- Looping Arrays, Breaking and Continuing
- Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops
- The While Loop
- Coding Challenge #4
