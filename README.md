## Description

Hi! I'm [Zahra](https://zahrakhadijha.com/):star_struck:! I'm a recent career-changer. I attended and graduated from General Assembly's Full Stack Software Engineering Immersive and I just landed my first role as a junior **Front End Engineer**. I'm passionate about my future in tech and the endless possibilities of what can be created. 

I'm interested in Front End Development, UX/UI, and Robotics. Some of my favorite things in the world include fitness, nature, art, museums, books, travel, YUMMY FOOD and being around people I love.

I've started and stopped the #100DaysOfCode challenge many times. However, I haven't fully stopped coding so I'd like to log my progress and my learnings. There is ALWAYS something to learn, even from the things you already know. I'm committing to this challenge to build a habit of communicating what I'm learning, to become a better engineer, to feel confident in Front End Engineering, and to fully immerse myself into a supportive community. 


So cheers to that! :clinking_glasses:

## Goal

* Become a confident and knowledgable engineer in Front End Development.
* Meet an amazing network of badass developers/engineers
