## Description

Hi! I'm [Zahra](https://zahrakhadijha.com/):star_struck:! I'm a Front End Engineer. I attended and graduated from General Assembly's Full Stack Software Engineering Immersive and I just landed my first role in front end development about 10 months ago. I'm passionate about my future in tech and the endless possibilities of what can be created so I want to participate in this challenge to level-up my knowledge.

I'm interested in Front End Development, UX/UI, and Robotics. Some of my favorite things in the world include fitness, nature, art, museums, books, travel, YUMMY FOOD and being around people I love.

I've started and stopped the #100DaysOfCode challenge many times. However, I would like to challenge myself to build a study habit of learning things I don't know outside of work so I will be logging my progress and learnings. There is ALWAYS something to learn, even from the things you already know. I'm committing to this challenge to build a habit of communicating what I'm learning, to become a better engineer, to feel confident in Front End Development so I can contribute to massive projects more.

So cheers to that! :clinking_glasses:

## Goal

My goal for the next 100 days are — 

* Become confident in my Front End Skills
* Update and clean up my technical my portfolio!
* Write 5 blog posts on a topic I've learned
* Create 2 Pure CSS art ✨
