## Description

I'm [Zahra](https://zahrakhadijha.com/), I'm a recent career-changer. I've graduated from General Assembly's Full Stack Software Engineering Immersive and I want to land my first dev job. I'm passionate about my future in tech and the endless possibilities of what can be created. 

I'm interested in Front End Development, UX/UI, and Robotics. Some of my favorite things in the world include fitness, nature, art, museums, books, travel & YUMMY FOOD and being around people I love.

I've started and stopped the #100DaysOfCode challenge many times. However, I haven't fully stopped coding so I'd like to log my progress and my learnings. I'm committing to this challenge to build a habit of communicating what I'm learning, to land my first dev job, and to fully immerse myself into a supportive community. 


So cheers to that! :clinking_glasses:

## Goal

* Land my first dev job in the first round of #100DaysOfCode
* Meet an amazing network of badass developers/engineers
