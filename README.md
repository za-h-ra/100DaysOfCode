## Description

I'm Zahra 👋🏼 I'm a Software Engineer looking for my next opportunity. I'm currently coding in JavaScript/React/TypeScript and learning Node.js.

I am also studying for technical interviews. Therefore, I'm dedicating this 100 Days of Code commitment to interview studying until I land that new adventure. 🥂

## Goal

My goal for the next 100 days are —

- [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) by Colt Steele
- Read Cracking the Coding Interview simultaneously
- [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann
- Write 3 blog posts about a topic I've learned
